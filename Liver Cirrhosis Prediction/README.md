# Liver Cirrhosis Prediction 

  

This project explores the application of machine learning to predict the risk of liver cirrhosis, a serious liver disease. Early detection allows for intervention and management to potentially slow disease progression. 

  

## Project Objectives: 

  

- Develop a machine learning model to identify individuals at high risk of developing liver cirrhosis based on various health factors. 

- Analyze the model's performance and assess the most influential factors contributing to risk. 

- Visualize the model's findings in a clear and informative manner to aid healthcare professionals. 

  

## Data Acquisition: 

  

This project utilizes a dataset containing relevant health information for individuals, potentially obtained from: 

- Electronic health records (anonymized) 

- Medical research institutions focusing on liver diseases 

  

## Methodology: 

  

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset will be cleaned, prepared, and explored to identify patterns and relationships between variables. 

- **Feature Engineering:** New features might be created from existing data to improve model performance. 

- **Model Selection and Training:** Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, or Random Forests will be evaluated for suitability. The chosen model will be trained on the prepared data. 

- **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance will be assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

- **Feature Importance Analysis:** We will identify the most influential features in the model's predictions for liver cirrhosis risk. 

- **Visualization:** The results will be visualized using techniques like feature importance plots and confusion matrices. 

  

## Project Deliverables: 

  

- Jupyter Notebook documenting the entire process, including data exploration, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and visualization. 

- README.md file summarizing the project objectives, methodology, results, and limitations. 

  

## Next Steps: 

  

- Explore the use of more advanced deep learning models for liver cirrhosis prediction, especially if image data (e.g., liver scans) is available. 

- Incorporate additional factors like lifestyle habits, family history, and environmental toxins into the analysis. 

- Consider developing a risk assessment tool based on the model's findings to aid in early identification of high-risk individuals.
