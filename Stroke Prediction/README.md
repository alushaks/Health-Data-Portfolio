# Stroke Prediction 

  

This project delves into the world of stroke prediction, aiming to identify individuals at high risk of stroke events. By leveraging machine learning models, we can potentially contribute to preventative measures and early intervention. 

  

## Project Objectives: 

  

- Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence based on various health factors. 

- Analyze the model's performance and identify key factors influencing stroke risk. 

- Visualize the model's findings in a clear and informative manner. 

  

## Data Acquisition: 

  

This project utilizes a dataset containing relevant health information for individuals, potentially obtained from: 

- Public health databases (anonymized) 

- Medical research institutions 

  

## Methodology: 

  

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset will be cleaned, prepared, and explored to identify patterns and relationships between variables. 

- **Feature Engineering:** New features might be created from existing data to improve model performance. 

- **Model Selection and Training:** Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Support Vector Machines will be evaluated for suitability. The chosen model will be trained on the prepared data. 

- **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance will be assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

- **Feature Importance Analysis:** We will identify the most influential features in the model's predictions for stroke risk. 

- **Visualization:** The results will be visualized using techniques like feature importance plots and confusion matrices. 

  

## Project Deliverables: 

  

- Jupyter Notebook documenting the entire process, including data exploration, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and visualization. 

- README.md file summarizing the project objectives, methodology, results, and limitations. 

  

## Next Steps: 

  

- Explore the use of more advanced deep learning models for stroke prediction. 

- Incorporate external factors like lifestyle habits and family history into the analysis. 

- Consider developing a risk assessment tool based on the model's findings.
