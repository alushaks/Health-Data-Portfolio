# COVID-19 Forecasting 

  

This project utilizes data science techniques to forecast future trends in COVID-19 cases and mortality rates, aiming to contribute to informed decision-making in public health interventions. 

  

## Project Objectives: 

  

- Develop a time series forecasting model to predict COVID-19 cases and mortality rates for a chosen location and timeframe. 

- Analyze the model's performance and identify potential limitations. 

- Visualize the forecasts alongside historical data for clear communication of insights. 

  

## Data Acquisition: 

  

This project utilizes data from reliable sources like: 

- [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public) 

- [Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) 

  

## Methodology: 

  

- **Data Preprocessing:** Downloaded data will be cleaned and prepared for time series analysis. 

- **Time Series Modeling:** A suitable model will be chosen from options like: 

  - ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) 

  - Prophet (Facebook's forecasting tool) 

  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Neural Networks (for complex patterns, requires more data and computational resources) 

- **Model Training and Evaluation:** The chosen model will be trained on historical data and evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 

- **Forecasting and Visualization:** The trained model will be used to generate forecasts for future COVID-19 cases and mortality rates. Results will be visualized alongside historical data for comparison. 

  

## Project Deliverables: 

  

- Jupyter Notebook documenting the entire process, including code, data exploration, model selection, and visualizations. 

- README.md file summarizing the project objectives, methodology, results, and limitations. 

  

## Next Steps: 

  

- Explore the incorporation of external factors like vaccination rates, travel restrictions, or social distancing measures into the model. 

- Compare the performance of different forecasting models for your chosen location. 

- Consider deploying the forecasts as a web application for continuous updates and interactive visualizations.
