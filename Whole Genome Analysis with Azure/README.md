# Whole Genome Analysis with Azure: Leveraging TB-GenomeExplorer 

  

This project delves into the world of whole genome analysis (WGA) using Microsoft Azure, specifically focusing on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterium causing tuberculosis (TB). We utilize the TB-GenomeExplorer repository, a valuable resource for streamlined WGA analysis of Mtb on Azure. 

  

## Project Objectives: 

  

- Leverage Azure cloud resources for scalable storage, processing, and analysis of large-scale WGA data from Mtb isolates. 

- Employ TB-GenomeExplorer's pre-built scripts and workflows to identify and analyze genomic features associated with Mtb virulence, drug resistance, and strain differentiation. 

- Gain insights into Mtb population dynamics and inform public health interventions for TB control. 

  

### Why TB-GenomeExplorer? 

  

TB-GenomeExplorer offers a convenient starting point for Mtb WGA analysis on Azure. It provides: 

- Streamlined Workflows: Pre-built scripts automate data processing, analysis, and visualization steps. 

- Scalability: Azure's cloud infrastructure efficiently handles large WGA datasets. 

- Reproducibility: Documented workflows facilitate replicable analysis. 

- Customization: The platform can be adapted to incorporate additional analysis tools. 

  

## Data Exploration and Analysis: 

  

We'll utilize TB-GenomeExplorer's scripts and Jupyter notebooks within the Azure environment. 

  

The analysis focuses on identifying and characterizing: 

- Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs): Genetic variations linked to drug resistance or strain types. 

- Insertion Sequences (IS elements): Mobile genetic elements influencing virulence and genome plasticity. 

- Mutations: Gene alterations potentially contributing to drug resistance or other phenotypes. 

  

Results will be visualized using interactive tools for exploration and interpretation. 

  

## Project Deliverables: 

  

- Jupyter Notebooks documenting the entire WGA analysis process on Azure using TB-GenomeExplorer. 

- Report summarizing findings regarding Mtb genomic features and their potential implications for TB control. 

  

## Next Steps: 

  

- Explore advanced bioinformatic tools for deeper Mtb genome analysis. 

- Integrate the analysis pipeline with public health databases for broader TB surveillance efforts. 

- Develop a web-based interface for user-friendly access to WGA analysis capabilities. 

  

This project showcases the power of cloud computing and open-source resources like TB-GenomeExplorer in advancing Mtb research and informing TB control strategies.
